# Description :
"""
    The program accepts the network topology details in terms of the cost of links, and provides the shortest path tree for the
    network. It uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to construct its routing table.
"""

# Logic :
"""
    1. The program first asks for a network topology file. It validates the data and
       store in matrix format.
    2. The next step is to create the connection table. The program takes the source
       router as input, and performs the Dijkstra Algorithm on it.
    3. For Dijkstra Algorithm, the program follows below steps:
        A. It selects the source node as the root of the tree and add it to the path.
           Then it sets the shortest distances for all the neighbors of the root to the cost
           between the root and those neighbors. Finally it sets the shortest distance of the root to zero.
        B. Then it repeats the following two steps in loop until all nodes are added to the path:
            a. It searches the for nodes which are not in the path. It then selects the one with minimum shortest distance and add it to the path.
            b. It updates the shortest distance for all remaining nodes using the shortest distance of the node just moved to the path in previous step.
    4. At every step, it keeps track of two type of nodes:
        A. The interface used to go to next router. (For connection table.)
        B. The parent node of last added node. (To create the final path.)
    5. Once both connection table and parent table are ready, the shortest path is
       found from given source to destination by following way :
        A. Starting from the destination node, it follows the parent node from the parent
           table to reach to the source, and provide the reverse path.
        B. The total cost is found by adding the cost of all the nodes in previous step.
    6. If there is no path from given source and destination, the program returns with
       such message.
    7. The program also performs some exception handling as described below:
        A. If there is no topology file as entered, it will generate an error message.
        B. If the entered source or destination router are invalid, it will generate an error message.
        C. If the entered source or destination router are same, it will generate an error message.
        D. If there is no source router selected before asking for the path, it will generate an error message.
